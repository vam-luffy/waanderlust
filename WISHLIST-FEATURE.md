# Wishlist Feature Implementation

## Overview
The wishlist feature allows users to save listings they're interested in to their profile for later viewing. This creates a personalized collection of favorite properties that users can easily access.

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes
- Added a `wishlist` array field to the User model that stores references to listing documents.

### Backend Implementation
- Added controller functions in `controllers/users.js`:
  - `renderWishlist`: Displays the user's wishlist items
  - `toggleWishlistItem`: Adds/removes a listing from a user's wishlist
  - `checkWishlistStatus`: Checks if a listing is already in a user's wishlist

- Added routes in `routes/user.js`:
  - GET `/user/wishlist` - View the wishlist page
  - POST `/user/wishlist/:listingId` - Toggle a listing in the wishlist
  - GET `/user/wishlist/:listingId/status` - Check if a listing is in the wishlist

### Frontend Implementation
- Created a new view at `views/users/wishlist.ejs` to display saved listings
- Added wishlist functionality to listing cards in index and show pages
- Added a dedicated wishlist card to the user profile dashboard
- Implemented interactive wishlist toggle buttons with the following features:
  - Visual feedback when a listing is added/removed from wishlist
  - Real-time UI updates without page reload
